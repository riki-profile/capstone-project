## Python Programming Fundamentals Project: Aplikasi Perpustakaan (Library Application)

This project is designed to measure my understanding of the fundamental concepts in Python programming, and to implement them using a simple library application written in Bahasa Indonesia.

The library application is designed to allow users to borrow and return books from a library. It includes features such as searching for books by title, displaying available books, and tracking borrowed books. The application is written entirely in Python, using basic programming concepts such as data collective types, and functions.

The code for the library application is written in Bahasa Indonesia to help demonstrate my ability to write clear and concise code in my native language. I hope that this project will serve as a testament to my dedication and hard work in the field of data science.
