## Python Programming Fundamentals Project: Aplikasi Perpustakaan (Library Application)

This project is designed to measure my understanding of the fundamental concepts in Python programming, and to implement them using a simple library application written in Bahasa Indonesia.

The library application is designed to allow users to borrow and return books from a library. It includes features such as searching for books by title or author, displaying available books, and tracking borrowed books. The application is written entirely in Python, using basic programming concepts such as data types, control structures, and functions.

The code for the library application is written in Bahasa Indonesia to help demonstrate my ability to write clear and concise code in my native language. The syntax and naming conventions used in the code follow industry best practices to ensure that the code is easy to read and understand.

Through this project, I aim to showcase my mastery of the basic concepts of Python programming and to demonstrate my ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. I hope that this project will serve as a testament to my dedication and hard work in the field of data science.
